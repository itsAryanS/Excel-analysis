This is an analysis of the annual sales of a store. In this analysis, I solely used #Excel for data cleaning, data processing, data analysis, data visualization, report making, and insight sharing.

Insights: 

1. The month of March has the highest sales volume.

2. Women are the primary purchasers. (approx.65%)

3. The majority of the items ordered have been delivered.

4. The top three buyers are Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh.

5. Adult women (30-49 years old) make up the majority of customers (50%)

6. Amazon's shopping site is the largest revenue generator.
